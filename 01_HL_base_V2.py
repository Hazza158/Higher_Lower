    **** How To Play ****
    You will start by choosing 2 numbers of your choice to guess between.

    Then the computer will choose a number at random between your 2 chosen numbers.

    You will then have a specific amount of guesses ranging from how big the difference in your 2 numbers is.

    You will guess a number and the computer will say either higher or lower to get you closer to your number.
    
    ****Good Luck!****
